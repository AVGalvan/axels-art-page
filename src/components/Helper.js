    text: `February was the month that I started documenting my work and practice sessions for drawing. I have been following the Drawabox course for most of my study time, and they recommend (“require” actually) that for every minute you spend doing exercises for the course, you spend the same amount of time drawing for fun. At first, I felt hesitant about this rule because I got it into my mind that “improving” only comes through focused study and practice, but they made a good point about needing to find your reason for drawing and seeing as how I don’t necessarily want to do this professionally right now, I went ahead and split my time evenly. So in between after drawing a bunch of boxes, I would draw whatever I thought might be fun. I still needed to get over the feeling of needing to draw “well” and do it for the sake of it, then I found a drawing of a blacksmith by Albert Urmanov and they had other pages detailing their brainstorming process. Urmanov’s prompts were: “Who”, “Intent”, “How”, “Gimmick”, and “Fear”. These were incredibly helpful in coming up with compelling ideas for sketches that told a story and happened to be very fun to actually work on. I didn’t work on my art as much as I expected I was going to (it was an incredibly busy month with life stuff) but, overall, I think this month was a pretty good start to the year. I particularly had fun with the "dragon kid" sketch.

    text: `This is to be the first of what will likely be many blog posts detailing whatever it is I want to jot down for posterity. Some of the things that one may expect later on: posts recalling art events, a look into whatever curriculum I am working on, goal setting, major events of relevance to my interests in art, and anything else that I feel would be useful to look back on later. This is largely a way to keep myself engaged and accountable to myself, but it could also be useful as a sort of timeline recounting my progress. For the tone of this page, I want to avoid anything too formal without being cavalier about form; drawing is fun and a creative outlet, however, I am balancing work and play to improve, so a smidgen of sobriety is likely in order. The first “real” post will likely be about the exercises and courses I have been working on for most of February; fortunately, we started off pretty early in the year, so we will be able to measure my progress by months as the year rolls on. Thank you for your time, I hope you found this peek into my existence amusing at the very least.`,
