    text: `This is to be the first of what will likely be many blog posts detailing whatever it is I want to jot down for posterity. Some of the things that one may expect later on: posts recalling art events, a look into whatever curriculum I am working on, goal setting, major events of relevance to my interests in art, and anything else that I feel would be useful to look back on later. This is largely a way to keep myself engaged and accountable to myself, but it could also be useful as a sort of timeline recounting my progress. For the tone of this page, I want to avoid anything too formal without being cavalier about form; drawing is fun and a creative outlet, however, I am balancing work and play to improve, so a smidgen of sobriety is likely in order. The first “real” post will likely be about the exercises and courses I have been working on for most of February; fortunately, we started off pretty early in the year, so we will be able to measure my progress by months as the year rolls on. Thank you for your time, I hope you found this peek into my existence amusing at the very least.`,
