        I was born in Southern California and raised there for the first five years of my life, and took to drawing as soon as I was able to hold a crayon. Animals were my fascination and I would often try to recreate the illustrated covers of the books that depicted gorillas, dinosaurs, or anything that interested me. With encouragement from my family, it became something of a crucial part of my identity as a child.<br/>
        As the years went on, my father’s work in the military meant that we never stayed in one place for too long. We skipped across the country for the next fourteen years before finally ending up back where we started. Throughout that time, I still continued drawing and making art, but at a pace that slowed more and more as the years went on. Art electives were the primary source of creative output for me, as they actually required finished products to pass the class, but outside of academic settings, the only time I would go out of my way to create art would be as gifts to friends and family. <br/>
        In 2019, I took an art class at a community college in Mississippi, and it made me rethink my relationship with art. Still life drawings were the focus of that class, and we would spend the three hours every other day just observing a collection of objects, trying to recreate them on the page. Every other art class I had taken up to that point was small potatoes when looking at the amount of concentration and dedication it required of its students. I took two more of those classes, and they have been very impactful on my attitude towards creativity and gave me an idea about the kind of work required to seriously improve on a craft. <br/>
        For many creatives, the pandemic has been a time to explore new avenues of creativity or dedicate more time to an existing skill, this was not the case for me. Stressors beyond the virus added to an already awful situation, and my production fell off again.  I would still finish projects for classes and a student showcase inspired me to make some new and interesting stuff, however, I have recently decided that maybe it’s time to make drawing a habit again and do it for the fun of it.
