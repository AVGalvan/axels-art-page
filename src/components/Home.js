      <p>
        Thank you for checking out this website that I made! My name is Axel, but unless you've blindly stumbled onto a random webpage (in which case, hello stranger) you probably already knew that. I have set up this website as a place to point someone towards if they were to show interest in my artistic work or endeavors and wanted to see more examples. This is also an exercise in web development and a way to benchmark my progress as I continue to learn about programming. One is never finished learning, and I have found that documenting my thoughts as I learn promotes a deeper understanding of the material I am studying and the headspace I was in at the time, so I have also made a blog page within the website where I can post thoughts, progress updates, announcements, or other media that doesn't readily fall into the purview of other parts of my website.
